About the project:
That's the first "real" project that I had to on my own.
That wasn't easy at first but it got easier when I took the time to
get back to documentation and learn how to solve bugs in my program.
I would say that the main difficulty here was to use the for loop correctly.
This is the thing I really had a hard time doing.
